# Social media avatar search

​	Review the beginnings of social platforms, all profit from the human's primal instincts, for example, Facebook's appearance rating，or WeChat's hookup use function "nearby people".

​    At present, the social media apps find other user only by matching their user name. But fact is a lot of people use the same avatar on different apps and their friends want discover them by avatar. 

​	Because lack of app's internal user data the search engine like Google and Baidu can only stand by with advanced CV tech.

​	So I think apps should ingredient the in app avatar search.
